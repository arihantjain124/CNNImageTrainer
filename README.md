# Image Classification/Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

Based on https://github.com/murtazahassan/Digits-Classification

It uses CNN to train image classification model which uses data from myData folder.

To use put images in folder based category with label being the name of folder and its images being the dataset. The Code reshapes the images in (32, 32, 3) to reduce Computational load on the system.

All the Parameter for CNN can be modified to suit your dataset.
